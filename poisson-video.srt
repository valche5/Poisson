1
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:46,210
WE COMPILE AND SEE THE NAME OF EXECUTABLE 

2
00:01:35,718 --> 00:01:40,312
For using the console in windows is neccessary to go to the command prompt of visual basic

3
00:01:51,031 --> 00:01:55,954
After that, we access to the compile directory and verify that the executable is there

4
00:02:19,491 --> 00:02:24,711
The program wait for a directory with 3 files named mask, source, and target

5
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:30,439
The mask show in white the portion of image source that will use

6
00:02:33,881 --> 00:02:49,901
here we verify that images has the same size

7
00:02:57,795 --> 00:03:07,075
Program wait for the directory with the files image source, target and mask and the name of the result image

8
00:03:14,786 --> 00:03:22,006
If i would like to use the mixed gradient, is neccesary to write the parameter -m before of the directory parameter

9
00:03:36,396 --> 00:03:39,396
Here is the result  of mixed gradient compare  with the normal gradient

10
00:03:42,206 --> 00:03:47,288
Look that the normal gradient is more evident the mask that i used in the final result

11
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:54,199
MERCI, GRACIAS, THANK YOU
